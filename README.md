# Side.Finance

Side.Finance is a new Decentralized Finance application to solve Ethereum network congestion problem as a governance token of the new Ethereum PoA sidechain.

Since our project starts with the implementation of redomination of YFI [https://gov.yearn.finance/t/redenominate-yfi/1296](https://gov.yearn.finance/t/redenominate-yfi/1296), every YFI holders holding more than 1 YFI token will receive a SIDE airdrop of 1:1000 ratio at Sept 5th 3:00 UTC +0.

After the airdrop has finished, new yield farming will start on Uniswap [https://app.side.finance](https://app.side.finance) \( Currently running on Goerli Testnet \), the total supply cap will be 90 million SIDE tokens \( 90,000,000 SIDE \), including the airdrop supply of 30 million \( 30,000,000 SIDE \) and new supply will be minted for Yield Farming on Uniswap for the first week, every week the minted supply will halve.
